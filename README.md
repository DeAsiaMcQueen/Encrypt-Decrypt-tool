# Encrypt-Decrypt-tool
## Introduction
The Encryption and Decryption Tool is a versatile application for secure text manipulation. It supports multiple encryption and decryption methods, including Caesar Cipher, Vigen√®re Cipher, Substitution Cipher, Transposition Cipher, Affine Cipher, Rail Fence Cipher, and Base64 Encoding/Decoding.
## Features
- Supports seven encryption and decryption methods.
- User-friendly graphical interface built with `Tkinter.`
- Single and multi-key input support.
- Real-time encryption and decryption processing.
## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries:
 - `tkinter` (included in Python standard library)
- `base64` (included in Python standard library)
- `string` (included in Python standard library)
- `itertools` (included in Python standard library)
## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DeAsiaMcQueen/EncryptionDecryptionTool.git
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd encryption-decryption-tool
3. Install needed libraries
   ```bash
   pip install base64
## Usage
1. Run application
   ```bash
   python Encryption&Decryption Tool.py
2. Use the GUI to
   - Select the encryption/decryption method.
   - Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt.
   - Enter the necessary key(s).
   - Type your plaintext in the input box and press Process to view the result.
## Future Enhancements
1. Support more advanced encryption algorithms (e.g., AES, DES).
2. Save and load encrypted/decrypted files directly.
3. Add a feature to generate random secure keys for the supported methods.
4. Implement a logging mechanism to track encryption/decryption operations.
5. Provide a visual representation of the ciphers (e.g., Rail Fence Cipher diagram).
